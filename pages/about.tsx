              Hey I&apos;m Patrick Raul Lang, a Computer Science and Media Master student from Germany. I primarily work in the TypeScript, JavaScript, and React ecosystem, but I love exploring new technologies like Flutter and 
              diving into app development with Kotlin. Although my main focus is frontend development, I also have experience in backend development through my personal and university projects.

            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            I am currently a working student at <span className={styles.highlight}>Mercedes Benz Tech Innovations</span> as
            where I work in the Artificial Intelligence team. I manage two large-scale AI projects, create quick code solutions primarily with React, and address UX questions related to our projects. 
            I also present and educate fellow employees and developers on our AI solutions and how to implement them using our interface or API solutions. 
            Previously, I worked for an E-Commerce agency focused on building online shops with Shopware. There, I was mainly responsible for redesigning and building the companyâ€™s website, 
            handling marketing tasks on social media, and managing automation and communication with HubSpot and Zapier.

            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Thanks to my extensive work in frontend development, I also enjoy designing. I create not only UI/UX designs but also digital art and videos using Adobe Premiere, 
            Photoshop, and Illustrator. I have been editing videos and producing digital art for over 10 years.

            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            In my free time, I love playing video games, volleyball, tennis, and football. I also enjoy creative pursuits like photography, 
            videography, and designing. Additionally, I am part of a group of friends where we constantly brainstorm and bring new ideas to life.
